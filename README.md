In progress. Currently can load and preview assets and assign/modify their tags. Each asset has a .glb, a .qml, a .history.json, and a .metadata.json. Models from Sketchfab - in order to render with Qt Quick 3D, need to preprocess the glbs with balsam.exe, incl. with Qt. 
See PythonScripts for some early tag prediction.
